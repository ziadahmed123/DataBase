# DataBase
Data : text , numbers , any type of data . 
Database : is an organized collection of data stored as multiple datasets.
Relational datbase : A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

## Difference between Database and Schema :

### primary key 
is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values.
### foreign key 
is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. 
it is a primary key in anather table .




### Normalization 
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.



Here is a list of Normal Forms in SQL:

1NF (First Normal Form)
2NF (Second Normal Form)
3NF (Third Normal Form)
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
5NF (Fifth Normal Form)
6NF (Sixth Normal Form)
